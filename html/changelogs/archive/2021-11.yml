  DTraitor:
  - qol: Converted Chemical Dispenser, ChemMaster and Reagent Grinder to TGUI
  - rscadd: Added pill bottle customisation to ChemMaster UI.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the pill bottle wouldn't do anything when you click
      human while targeting mouth.
  DeadLineSS13:
  - refactor: Refactored code with spritesheet/craft.
  Nanako:
  - experiment: 'Reduced human top speed. The intent here is to nerf the most extreme
      examples of zoomy humans without significantly affecting the majority of people.
      This is broken up into several changes:'
  - balance: Reduced the speed bonus of advanced femoral exoskeleton, Basic femoral
      unaffected
  - balance: Slightly Increased stamina costs of sprinting, and slightly reduced stamina
      regen
  - balance: Athletics skill is now broken into two skills, Hauling and Athletics.
      The former affects speed penalties from encumbrance, throwing, and pulling,
      the latter affects stamina costs.
  - balance: Slightly increased corruption slowdown effect on humans.
  - balance: Slightly decreased sprint speed, and slightly increased walking speed.
  - experiment: 'Increased Time To Kill (TTK) by 10% across the board. This is broken
      up into several changes:'
  - balance: Increased human limb health by 10%
  - balance: Increased human pain-shock threshold by 10%. from 50 to 55 This is the
      quantity of pain that can be suffered without any real bad effects.
  - tweak: Increased health of all necromorphs by 10%
2021-11-11:
  Nanako:
  - rscadd: Added a new defensive ability for slashers. Fend trades off movespeed
      for a powerful defensive buff, giving both incoming damage reduction, and an
      active block, especially for upperbody attacks from the front. Weaker attacks
      may even be ricocheted or parried and countered, depending on if they're ranged
      or melee respectively
2021-11-13:
  Nanako:
  - balance: Mining satchels and ore boxes now have a significantly smaller capacity,
      so they need to be hauled back to the processor more often. This change is designed
      to encourage cooperation, and slow down solo-miners. Bring a friend with you
      to carry your stuff!
  - bugfix: Fixed a major bug where rock turfs mined out with ranged toolguns (like
      plasma cutter and line cutter) were giving double ore yields. This was never
      an intended thing.
  - bugfix: Fixed a case where credits weren't being saved from payday and mining
      bonuses.
  - experiment: Reworked and reintroduced a legacy feature, Industrial Nets.
  - rscadd: Nets can be dispensed from a netroll by humans to cover areas of floor,
      and can be dispensed again to build a net wall. A netroll can also be used to
      pickup deployed nets and return them to the roll.
  - rscadd: Floor nets will reduce the speed, evasion, and defense of human-sized-mobs
      walking on them, and will block corruption from spreading into the tile. Net
      walls only impede movement, and do not provide cover against ranged attacks,
      or block vision.
  - rscadd: Net rolls can be found in random loot, or purchased from the store with
      the right schematic.
