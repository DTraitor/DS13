/*
General Explination:
The research datum is the "folder" where all the research information is stored in a R&D console. It's also a holder for all the
various procs used to manipulate it. It has four variables and seven procs:
Variables:
- tech_trees is a list of all /datum/tech that can potentially be researched by the player.
- all_technologies is a list of all /datum/technology that can potentially be researched by the player.
- researched_tech contains all researched technologies
- design_by_id contains all existing /datum/design.
- known_designs contains all researched /datum/design.
- experiments contains data related to earning research points, more info in experiment.dm
- research_points is an ammount of points that can be spend on researching technologies
- design_categories_protolathe stores all unlocked categories for protolathe designs
- design_categories_imprinter stores all unlocked categories for circuit imprinter designs
Procs:
- AddDesign2Known: Adds a /datum/design to known_designs.
- IsResearched
- CanResearch
- UnlockTechology
- download_from: Unlocks all technologies from a different /datum/research and syncs experiment data
- forget_techology
- forget_random_technology
- forget_all
The tech datums are the actual "tech trees" that you improve through researching. Each one has five variables:
- Name:		Pretty obvious. This is often viewable to the players.
- Desc:		Pretty obvious. Also player viewable.
- ID:		This is the unique ID of the tech that is used by the various procs to find and/or maniuplate it.
- Level:	This is the current level of the tech. Based on the ammount of researched technologies
- MaxLevel: Maxium level possible for this tech. Based on the ammount of technologies of that tech
