/*
	A store schematic is a consumable item which is found in random loot.

	Each one contains a single design ID. When used on a store kiosk, that design is uploaded, and it becomes available for purchase

	In the event that the design is already uploaded, it will change to a different one


	At the end of a round, some uploaded schematics will be lost to data corruption
